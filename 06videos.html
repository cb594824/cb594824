        <li>From the start of the video, I was unsure of what I would be learning. However, once the first part of the triology began, I became more interested, especially because of how close the information matched the information which we are learning in class. Although we have covered a majority of the information, it was refreshing to go over the various types of styling. With so much information coming in daily, my head is sometimes too cluttered to even realize where I learned a specific fact. The different types of css style is something that is easily confused. I found it interesting that the external css style sheet is found to be the easiest. I think my reasoining for the confusion is based on the fact that I often mix up my style sheet with the piece of information that I am attempting to create. I was unaware of the fact that you could use the link attribute and add interactive styles to links by using a pseudo element; actually, I had no idea pseudo elements even existed. Overall, I come away with the opinion that these videos were educational, and not a complete waste of time.</li>

        <p>
        <li>After having used the css validator in the past, when working on coding our resumes for our project portfolio, I did not understand completely how my page would bounce straight from 10 errors to 45 errors all in one simple change. This video, "10 Things I Didn't Know About HTML" made things a little more clear. When Mathais Bynens described the process of a Document Type Definition, and broke down how the elemnts describe what is translated in the document, I was able to begin and understand the process a little bit better. However, I am still a little unclear as to how something can appear correct to a computer, or css validator, if it is overall incorrect. In addition, I am confused as to why it is seen as so important to open and close our html tags correctly, when Mathais Bynens describes the process as optional. If the use of tags is opitional, then what is the overall point of using tags the specify the process? Why can't we just use bullets and other formatting that we might use as we do in Microsoft Word.</li>
            
        <li>Document Type Definitions, otherwise known as DTD, is a document that defines all the elements that a certain language supports.</li>
        <li><strong>character references</strong>to escape characters you can use a semi-colon</li>
        <li>you can omit <strong>closing tags</strong>and the item may still be valid/you can omit their <strong>opening tags</strong> as well and it will still render the exact same way as it had with the open/close tags because the browser believes they are implied elements</li>
        <li><strong>css font-family codes</strong> cannot start with a number</li>

        <li>I would not go as far as saying I enjoyed this video, partially because I did not understand the point of it. I understand that we are the future and that we are the creators of what is expressed online and offline. However, I do not understand the importance of displaying the differences in technology over time. As time goes on, the idea of mellenials being the technology experts continues to remain the same, as well as gain proof. As a complete civilization, we should be working towards eliminating clutter, and learning not to depend solely on the use of technology anymore. It has gotten to the point that we are on our phones, laptops, cameras, or other types of technology, more than we are interacting face to face with individuals. The idea of bullshit is completely accurate, but I believe this information is something that we all already know and understand. As a consumer, why do I need to be taught something that I already know; that we are going to continue to be bombarded with information and soon create information overload.</li>
        <li>there were <strong>5 exabytes</strong> of informaton created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that information is now created every 2 days, and the pace is increasing - Eric Schmidt</li>
        <li>2.4 billion people have access to the web, while, a majority of the world still does not have access to the web</li>
        <li>if we continue down the path fo technology evolvement, we will forever continue to be bombarded with information.<em>technology overload!</em>
